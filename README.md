A program for a hypothetical ebook shop to access and edit a database on books they are selling. The 'creating_ebookstore_db.py' file is for creating 
the database, the 'using_ebookstore_db.py' is the program the hypothetical shop owner would use to access and edit the database.


*Installation*

A code editor able to read .py files can be used to run the program, and the relevant text files must be in the same folder as the program.
